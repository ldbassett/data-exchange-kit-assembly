# Data Exchange: Kit Assembly

A tiny, zero-backend browser game with a cellular-automaton vibe. Built with Vite + React + Tailwind.
- `/` landing
- `/play` phone-first kit collection + scoring (local only)
- `/board` animated projector view (demo-friendly)

## Quickstart
1. Install deps: `npm install`
2. Dev: `npm run dev`
3. Build: `npm run build` (output `dist/` for static hosting like Vercel)

## Notes
- No server, no database. State is localStorage only.
- Colors: primary `#1f6feb`, accent `#ffd200`.
